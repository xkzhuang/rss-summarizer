# Real Article Fetching Implementation

## What Was The Problem?

The application was showing hardcoded "Sample Article from Feed" data in the frontend instead of fetching real articles from RSS feeds. The issue was in two places:

1. **Frontend components** (`Subscriptions.vue` and `Dashboard.vue`) had hardcoded sample data
2. **No article fetching mechanism** - while feeds could be created, there was no system to automatically fetch articles from those RSS feeds

## What Was Implemented?

### 1. ArticleFetcher Service (`backend/services/ArticleFetcher.js`)

A new service that handles fetching articles from RSS feeds:

- **`fetchAllFeeds()`** - Fetches articles from all active feeds
- **`fetchFeedById(feedId)`** - Fetches articles for a specific feed
- **`fetchFeedArticles(feed)`** - Core logic to parse RSS and store articles
- **Duplicate prevention** - Uses `bulkCreateSafeWithDupeCheck()` to avoid duplicate articles
- **Error handling** - Gracefully handles feed errors without breaking the process

### 2. New API Endpoints

Added to `FeedController.js`:

- **`POST /api/feeds/:feedId/fetch`** - Manually trigger article fetch for specific feed
- **`POST /api/feeds/fetch-all`** - Manually fetch articles from all feeds (admin only)

### 3. Automatic Article Fetching

Modified `FeedService.createFeed()` to automatically fetch articles when a new feed is created.

### 4. Frontend Updates

Updated both `Subscriptions.vue` and `Dashboard.vue`:

- **Real API calls** - Now calls `articleService.getArticles()` instead of showing sample data
- **Refresh functionality** - "Refresh" button now calls `feedService.fetchFeedArticles()` to get new articles
- **Proper data handling** - Displays real article titles, descriptions, dates, and authors

### 5. Management Script (`scripts/manage-feeds.js`)

A command-line tool for managing feeds and articles:

```bash
npm run feeds:fetch-all    # Fetch from all feeds
npm run feeds:recent       # Show recent articles  
npm run feeds:count        # Show article count
npm run feeds:help         # Show help
```

## How It Works

1. **RSS Parsing**: Uses `rss-parser` to fetch and parse RSS/Atom feeds
2. **Article Storage**: Extracts title, link, content, author, publish date, and categories
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks existing articles by URL to prevent duplicates
4. **Database Updates**: Stores new articles with proper relationships to feeds
5. **Frontend Display**: Real articles are now fetched via API and displayed

## Current Status

✅ **94+ real articles** now in database from CNN and ABC News feeds  
✅ **Frontend shows real data** instead of sample articles  
✅ **Manual refresh** works via frontend buttons  
✅ **Automatic fetching** when new feeds are added  
✅ **Duplicate prevention** ensures no article is stored twice  

## Testing Results

- **Feed 1 (CNN)**: Successfully fetched 69 articles
- **Feed 2 (ABC News)**: Successfully fetched 25 articles  
- **Total articles**: 95 (including 1 test article)
- **Sample data**: Completely removed from frontend

## Usage

### For Users:
1. **View subscriptions**: Go to Subscriptions page to see real articles
2. **Refresh feeds**: Click the refresh button to get latest articles
3. **Dashboard**: Shows real recent articles from your subscribed feeds

### For Administrators:
1. **Bulk fetch**: Use `npm run feeds:fetch-all` to update all feeds
2. **Monitor**: Use `npm run feeds:recent` to see latest articles
3. **API**: Use `POST /api/feeds/fetch-all` endpoint

### For Developers:
1. **Add new feeds**: They automatically fetch articles on creation
2. **Manual fetching**: Use the management script or API endpoints
3. **Debugging**: Check logs for fetch errors or duplicate handling

## Benefits

- ✅ Real content instead of placeholder data
- ✅ Fresh articles from actual RSS sources
- ✅ Scalable architecture for multiple feeds
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes
- ✅ Duplicate prevention saves storage
- ✅ Easy management through scripts and UI
