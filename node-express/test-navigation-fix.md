# Navigation Fix Test Instructions

## Problem Description
The "All Articles" tab was causing other tabs (Dashboard, Browse Feeds, My Feeds) to return 304 (Not Modified) responses after being clicked, preventing proper data loading.

## Root Cause
1. **Inconsistent User ID handling**: The frontend was passing `userId` parameter that could become null/undefined
2. **Browser caching**: 304 responses were being cached inappropriately for dynamic content
3. **State corruption**: The `feedStore.currentUserId` getter was unreliable and could change unexpectedly

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/`)

1. **Articles.vue**: Removed unreliable `userId` parameter from API calls
   - Let backend determine user from auth token instead
   - Prevents state corruption issues

2. **Dashboard.vue**: Same fix - removed `userId` parameter

3. **services/api.js**: Added cache-busting headers for article requests
   - Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
   - Added `Pragma: no-cache` and `Expires: 0`
   - Only applied to GET requests for `/articles` endpoints

### Backend Changes (`backend/controllers/`)

4. **ArticleController.js**: 
   - Changed to always use `req.user?.id` instead of unreliable `userId` param
   - Added cache-busting response headers to prevent unwanted browser caching
   - Ensures consistent user identification

## Test Procedure

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/shin/projects/web-app/06-newsfeed-summary/node-express
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login and test navigation**:
   - Login to the application
   - Navigate to Dashboard - should load articles
   - Navigate to Browse Feeds - should work
   - Navigate to My Feeds - should work  
   - **Navigate to All Articles - should work**
   - **Navigate back to Dashboard - should still work (this was broken before)**
   - **Navigate to Browse Feeds - should still work**
   - **Navigate to My Feeds - should still work**

3. **Check browser network tab**:
   - Should see proper 200 responses instead of 304 responses
   - API calls should complete successfully
   - No more "304 bite.svg" or empty responses

## Expected Results
- All tab navigation should work seamlessly
- No more 304 Not Modified responses for dynamic content
- Consistent data loading across all tabs
- User-specific content loads properly in all views

## If Issues Persist
- Check browser developer tools Network tab for API responses
- Look for console errors in browser
- Verify backend logs for authentication/authorization issues
